#Open Source Operations - punching up

This talk was mostly about promoting Canonical's jujucharms which:

>"Juju is an application and service modelling tool that enables you to quickly model, configure, deploy and manage applications in the cloud with only a few commands. Use it to deploy hundreds of preconfigured services, OpenStack, or your own code to any public or private cloud."

The problem: too much software. When googling for solutions you'll find 5/6 pieces of software.
 
Proliferation of software, every problem has at least 
three solutions. 

Now you have two problems (having to evaluate the solution too), or 3 if you choose to write your own

Are you an expert? To evaluate the software you have to become an expert. How fast does it take you to be production ready?

Are you an expert unicorn? "do you know every bit of software we could ever want to deploy"

Operations is the real scarcity today

Open sourcing operations, helps evaluate sofware, moves apps to production, gets you back to working on cooler things.
