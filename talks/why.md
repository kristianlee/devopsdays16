# The importance of ‘why’ for software operations.

I didn't engage very much with this talk. It seemed like quite an obvious though but still.. 

- Why is the most important question. 
 
- Don't tell people 'what to do, and how to do it'
Situations can change, previous decisions will be wrong, people need the 'why' so that they can understand the vision.
