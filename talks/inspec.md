#Preparing for the Day After Tomorrow - Test-Driven Infrastructure

This talk was effectively around running Integration Tests for your Infrastructure. 

I don't have too many notes on it, but the gist was, that chef have written ['Inspec'](https://github.com/chef/inspec) which is a framework around which infrastructure tests can be built.

> "You can only deliver as quickly as you can fail"
> "We can treat out infrastructure like software"

Looks really interesting, need to look into ways of applying it to ISE's infrastructure.
