#You Don't Belong Here: Dealing with Imposter Syndrome

Again, I didn't take a tonne of notes for this one, but it was a very interesting talk that definitely struck a chord with me. 

Imposter Syndrome is defined as:
>Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

Recent estimates say that it affects up to 70% of people.
