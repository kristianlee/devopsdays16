#Working in and with Open Source Communities

What is a community? Bulettin board / OSS etc etc - people sharing common values and purpose. 

Are you working as a member or leader?

Realise that everyone is a member (independent of time spent etc) - everyone has the same  responsibility. 

Disagree with ideas and not the people

Bring new members and take care of the next generation

Don't be a redshirt!! 


##As a lead:
Maintain the balance between the strong and the weak (usuallly they're not loud)
Take care of internal culture
Don't be a control freak
Create a transparent community environment

##Community maintenance and rules: 
Talk talk talk and meet as much as you can (and you can afford)
Try to be nice as long as possible
Don't accept harassment

##Code of conduct:
Having one is very important - everyone is responsible for it
Taking care is much more important
