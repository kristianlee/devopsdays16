#My Impressions
Erica spoke with eloquence about her experiences of the challenges she's faced (and the industry faces) around Diversity and Inclusion. 

She was pretty damning about Google's salary inequity between minorities, and the rest of the workshop. She was the organiser of openly sharing a spreadsheet containing any willing participant's salary.

She didn't explicitly say so, but I got the impression that she left Google for Slack as a result of the discoveries she made on that survey (read more about it [here](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/21/ex-google-employee-exposes-unequal-pay-with-spreadsheet/)) 

She talked about the lack of pipeline to jobs in general for black and hispanic graduates out of university. 
> "Working twice as hard as other people to get into their jobs"

In the tech arena, the majority of candidates hired out of university in America come from a small group of universities, mostly Berkeley + Stanford. Those universities are also notable for their mostly white and asian graduates. 

She thinks this is key, the graduate pipeline was compared to the build pipeline, in that little things early in the process can effect many builds - i.e. if we fix diversity in the top Universities, more hiring of more diverse candidates will happen. 

Another important way to help, is to start on the D&I (diversity and inclusion) journey early in a company's life:
> "Hard to fix when you're a tanker, why not do it when you're a dinghy"

She also talked about the theory of Meritocracy:

mer·i·toc·ra·cy
ˌmerəˈtäkrəsē/
noun
government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability

She mentioned that the theory's author, made it up as a joke, yet it continues to be used. 
> "We should stop using it a serious model in tech"

To conclude the talk, she said when discussing D&I:
> "Be willing to get uncomfortable"

On quotas:
>"Setting quotas is important - you can't make improvements without measuring what you're doing"

In the Q&A she was asked about some of the things that had been done at Slack to help the situation:

She mentioned that they'd had difficulty attracting female candidates when "x Years of Experience in y is required for this position" statements were in the job descriptions. 
They've now removed all such statements from JDs, they simply asses the candidates skills in any given technology at the interview now.
