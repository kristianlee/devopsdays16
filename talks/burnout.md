#What weâ€™re learning about burnout and how a DevOps culture can help

Why should we address burnout? - 
Google rework blog, looking into successful teams - no 1 on the list was psychological safety (if you don't feel safe to fail, won't take risks).
 
What is devops - a culture where people regardless of title or background, work together to imagine, develop, deploy and operate a system. 

The truth about burnout, 3 factors listed that contribute:
1. Exhaustion
2. Cynicism
3. Professional Efficacy (Measures feelings of competence and successful achievement in one's work)

What causes burnout: always more likely when there is a mismatch in the nature of what you're being asked to vs what you want to do. 

1. Work Overload
2. Lack of control
3. Insufficient reward
4. Breakdown of communication
5. Absense of fairness
6. Conflicting values


1. Too many hours - devops doesn't necessarily help this. Although, work is maybe more visible, more work sharing, less deploy marathons (continuous delivery). 
2. Teams are ultimately responsible for decisions, use the right technology and tools for the team - although this oden't mean a devops team controlling what others do. 
3. Money isn't a very good motivator.
4. Everyone involved with the product is on the same team, pairs with different skill sets are common, swarming can be done when required, blameless retrospectives are held
5. You build it, you run it - everyone is responsible for quality, everyone is measured the same way, everyone goes to the release party. Although metrics drive behaviours (if someone's measured on something, chances are, they'll make it happen).

Things you can do:

- Pay attention to how you feel
- Try out the Maslach Burnout Inventory (www.mindgarden.com/117-maslach-burnout-inventory
- Increase your self awareness
Talk to someone (professional help is the best, they're trained to identify cause and effect, can recommend treatment, don't feel ashamed - friends and family, people who care that you haven't even met)
- Safety Check - in important meetings, everybody surreptitiously writes down a number from 1-5 rating how safe they feel. The numbers are handed in, and they average out that number.
