#Document Writing in CI Environment

Surprise, surprise, Kristian liked the documentation talk. 

This was a talk based around the ['Red Pen'](http://redpen.cc) tool. As you do in other languages with linting tools:
>"Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors."

Red Pen allows you to run a lint test against documentation that you've written. 

I thought it's a really cool concept, and it would be neat if we could get it to automatically run against all of our 'README.md' files on github?
