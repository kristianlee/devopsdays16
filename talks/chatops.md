Radically Open Security are a non-profit, distributed company who run pen tests for clients.

>ChatOps, a term widely credited to GitHub, is all about conversation-driven development. By bringing your tools into your conversations and using a chat bot modified to work with key plugins and scripts, teams can automate tasks and collaborate, working better, cheaper and faster.

The tool they use is ['Rocket Chat'](https://rocket.chat/) - we should definitely look at it instead of HipChat. It's Open Source, and we could put it in pretty easily (includes integrations with other tools too).
