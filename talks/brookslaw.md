#Breaking Brooks' Law with DevOps

The complete presentation is [here](brookslaw.pdf).

The basic idea of Brook's Law is that in the past, if you wanted to build a system faster, you'd throw more engineers at it. Brooks Law proved that by doing so, you make things worse.

Ways Brooks suggests to help break the law:

- No More Meetings (no talking, just get stuff done)
- Communicate More
> "Teams should communicate with one another in as many ways as possible"
- Communication is a network, not a tree - i.e. don't have everything going through a management structure, democractise it.
