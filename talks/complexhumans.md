This was a super-quick talk, but very interesting, talking about the complex nature of belief / culture in humans, and how we should apply to dev ops.

We have 90,000,000 brain cells, most of the processing we do is subconscious.

Reptilian == legacy code (hard to reprogram). An analogy for this for the brain:
Finding a path that goes in a forest, it's easier to go down the well trodden path, but possible to forge new ones. Step back and take a think about what we're doing.
