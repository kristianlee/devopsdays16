#Introduction to designing scalable services on Amazon's Web Services

I took this workshop because I've not really played much with AWS in the past, and was interested to find out more after my experience in Azure.  

Unfortunately the instructor was super-quick to go through each step, and the class depended on us having an AWS subscription set up already (which I did not!) 

My impression of the service is that it's very clever about setting thresholds for up and downscaling web apps, and has a huge amount of tools for doing so. 

The UI is not very pretty, but functional enough. 

If anyone else has an AWS account, and wants to try out what we did, the full workshop is [here](https://github.com/AndrewFarley/devops-day-amsterdam-2016-aws-autoscaling-workshop) (includes slides and practical material)
