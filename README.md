devopsdays Amsterdam '16 Report

My three main takeaways:

1) [Habitat](talks/habitat.md) looks great, and is something we should definitely look at for Yammer. 

2) [Reliability Mathematics](talks/reliability.md) are much more interesting than the phrase would suggest

3) devopsdays was much more invested in talks about culture, diversity and philosophy than I'd expected (and admirably so). 

##Day 1
Was fully dedicated to workshops - these were interactive sessions in which as an atendee you'd follow the instructor through setting up a service / working with a new environment etc. 

They were 2hrs 30 each, and you had 6 to choose from in each of the 3 slots. 

I chose:

- [Docker from Scratch](workshops/dockerfromscratch.md)
- [Going Elastic](workshops/goingelastic.md)
- [Introduction to designing scalable services on Amazon's Web Services](workshops/aws.md)


##Day 2 + 3
The next two days were organised like this:
- Morning schedule of 4 talks
- 1 more afternoon talk
- 4 'ignite talks'
- 'Open Space' discussions on a variety of topics

###Talks
The talks were traditional lecture-style presentations about any given technology or culture / philosophy topic, I've taken notes (and included slide links where I could).

The **bolded** ones were the ones I found the most interesting.

The ~~strikethrough~~ talks were ones I didn't enjoy / didn't really seem to say much of interest (I haven't written them up)/ 

####Thursday
**[Erica Baker - Slack - Keynote](talks/ericabaker)**

**[Adam Jacob - Chef - The Evolution of Automation](talks/habitat.md)**

[Daniël van Gils (Cloud66) 
How the hell do I run my microservices in production, and will it scale?](talks/microservices.md)

~~Warner Moore (CoverMyMeds) 
DevOps has Always Been About Security~~

**[Avishai Ish-Shalom (Fewbytes) 
The Mathematics of Reliability, supersuper interesting](talks/reliability.md)**

####Friday
[Ken Mugrage (Thoughtworks) 
What we’re learning about burnout and how a DevOps culture can help](talks/burnout.md)

**[Victoria Jeffrey (Chef) 
Preparing for the Day After Tomorrow - Test-Driven Infrastructure](talks/inspec.md)**

[Desmond Delissen
Continuous testing in the world of APIs](talks/minosse.md)

~~Harm Weites (Wehkamp) 
One engineer, four environments, no termination protection.~~

###Ignite Talks
This was an interesting concept, whereby participants were given 6 minutes to present about their topic. Their presentations should consist of exactly 20 slides, and would be automatically moved through (i.e. each slide will be on screen for 18 seconds).

The idea was to get a full run-through of the topic in a short time, and those who had organised their slides well, came off the best. 

Below were the ignite talks I saw (organised in order of my interest in them):

- [Takahiko Ito - Document Writing in CI Environment](talks/redpen.md)
- [Jody Wolfborn - You Don't Belong Here: Dealing with Imposter Syndrome](talks/imposter.md)
- [Will Button (Trax) - An ElasticSearch Cluster Named George Armstrong Custer](talks/custer.md)
- [Hannah Foxwell (Pendrica) - Systems are Simple. Humans are Complex.](talks/complexhumans.md)
- [Gopal Ramachandran (TMNS) - Test driven Dockerized infrastructure](talks/tddi.md)
- [Jason Yee (Datadog) - Breaking Brooks' Law with DevOps.](talks/brookslaw)
- [Bernd Erk - Working in and with Open Source Communities](talks/ossc.md)
- [Pavel Chunyayev (Levi9) - The importance of ‘why’ for software operations.](talks/why.md)
- [Marco Ceppi - Open Source Operations - punching up](talks/ossops.md)
